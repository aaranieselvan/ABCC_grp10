# **RNA Sequencing Analysis** {style="color: pink;"}

## Setting up with the High Performance Cluster (HPC)

### Log in to the HPC

``` {bash="FALSE"}
ssh -i~/.ssh/create_msc k21056636@hpc.create.kcl.ac.uk
```

### Create directories to organise the raw data, outputs, and script files

``` {bash="FALSE"}
mkdir group_10
cd group_10/

# Create a directory containing scripts to reproduce methods section 
mkdir readmes

# Create a directory with the outputs of the scripts 
mkdir outputs 

# Create a directory with the raw data, such as RNA FASTA files and the reference genome.
mkdir originals
```

### Download the data

Downloading the data using a nano script, and submitting as a batch job
enables higher efficiency.

``` {bash="false"}
# Create a nano-script for automated download of the FASTQ files
nano fastq.sh 

# Input the following download commands to the script

#!/bin/bash 

# Download FASTQ files from the specified FTP server 
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR113/068/SRR11318268/SRR11318268_2.fastq.gz 
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR113/070/SRR11318270/SRR11318270_1.fastq.gz 
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR113/070/SRR11318270/SRR11318270_2.fastq.gz 
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR113/071/SRR11318271/SRR11318271_2.fastq.gz 
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR113/069/SRR11318269/SRR11318269_2.fastq.gz 
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR113/071/SRR11318271/SRR11318271_1.fastq.gz 
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR113/068/SRR11318268/SRR11318268_1.fastq.gz 
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR113/069/SRR11318269/SRR11318269_1.fastq.gz

# Save and exit the nano script 
```

### Use Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to Upload the Reference Genome

The reference genome, has been downloaded from the NCBI database to the
local disk. It needs to be copied over onto the HPC by connecting to
this remote server via SFTP using a private key. This step is done in a
separate terminal window.

``` {bash="false"}
# Connect to a HPC Create via SFTP using a private key 
sftp -i~/.ssh/create_msc k21056636@hpc.
create.kcl.ac.uk

# Check remote working directory 
pwd

# Check local working directory 
lpwd 

# Direct to the working directory to where the reference genome is found on the local disk
lcd /Users/aaranie.s/Desktop

# Copy the folder containing the reference genome to the HPC.
put -r ref_genome 

# Exit, once the files are successfully uploaded over. 
exit()
```

## Quality Control

### Create nano script to quality control the fastqc files

``` {bash="false"}
nano group_10 script 

#!/bin/bash

echo "start of the pipeline"

module load fastqc

# Define base and results directories
baseDirectory="/scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/originals"
resultsDirectory="/scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/outputs"

# Create the results directory if it does not exist
mkdir -p "$resultsDirectory"

# Run Fast-QC on all .fastq.gz files in baseDirectory
fastqc -o "$resultsDirectory" -t 4 "$baseDirectory"/*.fastq.gz

echo "end of the pipeline"
```

### Log in into the interactive node, and execute the job

``` {bash="false"}
# Execute a job interactively or within a batch script, by running commands on compute nodes for the msc_appbio partition 
srun -p msc_appbio --pty /bin/bash

# Submit a script via sbatch 
sbatch fastqc.sh 

# Monitor the  if the batch job is running (>10seconds = successful)
squeue -u k21056636 

# Check SLURM files to see up to date logs on the job 
less slurm-(jobnumber).out 
```

## Indexing and Alignment

### Indexing : Create a genome index, using STAR

``` {bash="false"}
#!/bin/bash 

# Load in the specific version of STAR. 
module load star/2.7.10b-gcc-13.2.0

# When running this on the command line, in a batch script ensure there are no extra spaces. There are extra spaces here to comment out the code. 
STAR 
  --runThreadN 10 # Number of threads used (i.e 10)
  --runMode genomeGenerate # genomeGenerate mode 
  --genomeDir /scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/originals/index/ # Path to store genome directory
  --genomeFastaFiles /scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/ref_genome/GCF_000146045.2/GCF_000146045.2_R64_genomic.fna # Path to where the FASTA (raw data) files are located 
  --sjdbGTFfile /scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/ref_genome/GCF_000146045.2/genomic.gtf # Path to GTF file 
```

### Alignment using the STAR aligner

``` {bash="false"}
#!/bin/bash 

# Prints line 
echo "start of the pipeline"

# Define the base directory, results directory and the genome directory 
 
baseDirectory="/scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/originals/" # The base directory is the location of the raw sequencing data containing FASTA files

resultsDirectory="/scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/outputs/" # The results directory is the location of where the outputs will be saved 

genomeDir="/scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/originals/index/" # The genomeDir is the directory containing the genome index for STAR alignment

# List files from the base directory that match the pattern "_1.fastq.gz" to remove them; extracting only the base name. 
samples=$(ls "$baseDirectory"/*_1.fastq.gz | sed 's/_1.fastq.gz//' | xargs -n 1 basename)

# Create a loop where samples are aligned using STAR and the genome index, saving the outputs as a BAM file. 
for sample in $samples; do # Iterates through each item in the samples variable 
  echo "Processing sample: $sample" # Prints a message indicating which sample is being processed 

STAR 
  --runThreadN 16 # Number of threads used (i.e 16) 
  --genomeDir "$genomeDir" # Specifies the directory containing the STAR genome index
  --readFilesCommand zcat # Decompresses the .gz files 
  --readFilesIn "$baseDirectory${sample}_1.fastq.gz" "$baseDirectory${sample}_2.fastq.gz" # Specifies the input paired end FASTQ files 
  --outFileNamePrefix "$resultsDirectory${sample}_" # Output files start with the sample name
  --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate # Specifies output as a BAM file, sorted by genomic coordinates 

done # End of loop 

echo "pipeline completed" # Prints a message indicating all samples have been 

# Exit editor

# Submit a batch job, whilst on the interactive node
sbatch alignment.sh 

# Queue the job to check if it is running. Slurm files detail whether the job was successful for each sample. This job took approximately 4 hours on the CPU partition. 
squeue -u k21056636
```

## Feature Counts

### Create directory for Feature Counts output

``` {bash="false"}
mkdir -p outputs/featureCounts
```

### Load subread module in order to perform read counting using featureCounts

``` {bash="false"}
# Load subread module in order to perform read counting using featureCounts
module load subread

# Verify module has been loaded 
module list
```

### Perform Read Counting by running featureCounts

``` {bash="false"}
featureCounts -T 10 # Use 10 threads 
-a /scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/ref_genome/GCF_000146045.2/genomic.gtf # Path to annotation file 
-o /scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/outputs/featureCounts/all_samples_gene_counts.txt # Output file where the gene counts will be saved 
-t exon # Count reads mapped to 'exon' features in the GTF file
-g gene_id # Group counts by 'gene_id' in the GTF file 
-p # Enable counting for paired end reads 
-B # Requires pair-end reads to be aligned properly 
--countReadPairs /scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/outputs/SRR11318268_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam /scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/outputs/SRR11318269_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam /scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/outputs/SRR11318270_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam /scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/outputs/SRR11318271_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam # Counts paired end reads in each sample. 
```

### Copy the featureCounts outputs from the HPC to local drive.

#### This step is carried out in the local terminal.

``` {bash="false"}
scp k21040223@erc-hpc-login1.create.kcl.ac.uk:/scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/outputs/featureCounts/all_samples_gene_counts.txt ~/Desktop/
scp k21040223@erc-hpc-login1.create.kcl.ac.uk:/scratch_tmp/grp/msc_appbio/group10/outputs/featureCounts/all_samples_gene_counts.txt.summary ~/Desktop/ 
```

## Normalisation and Data Analysis

### Install/load the required libraries for normalisation and data analysis

```{r}
# Install and Load required libraries and dependencies
tinytex::install_tinytex(force = TRUE)
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("edgeR")
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
BiocManager::install("tidyverse")

library("tidyverse")
library("edgeR")
library("DESeq2")
```

### Verify working directory (Set if necessary)

```{r}
getwd()
```

### Load and verify gene counts data from featureCounts

```{r}
# Read the gene counts data into a data frame
gene_counts <- read.table("~/Desktop/featureCounts/all_samples_gene_counts.txt",
                          header = TRUE, # Use first row as column header
                          row.names = 1, # Set the first column as row names (i.e gene IDs)
                          comment.char = "#", # Ignore lines starting with #
                          sep = "\t") # Separators are tab-delimited files
gene_counts
```

### Formatting

```{r}
# Display the first few rows of the data set to confirm it has been loaded correctly 
head(gene_counts)

# Check the dimensions (rows = genes, columns = samples)
dim(gene_counts)
```

### Preparing Gene Count Data for Analysis

```{r}
# Extract gene lengths for normalisation 
gene_lengths <- gene_counts$Length

# Remove annotation columns (e.g., gene lengths) to isolate the count data 
gene_counts <- gene_counts[, -c(1:5)]

# Verify that the data contains only raw counts for analysis 
head(gene_counts)
```

### Create metadata to define sample conditions and replicates

#### This ensures proper mapping of biological conditions during differential analysis

```{r}
# Create a data frame containing sample information, the condition/treatment applied and replicates
metadata <- data.frame(
    sample = c("SRR11318268", "SRR11318269", "SRR11318270", "SRR11318271"),
    condition = c("control", "control", "methanol_treatment", "methanol_treatment"),
    replicate = c("control_rep1", "control_rep2", "treatment_rep1", "treatment_rep2")
)

# Set the row names of the data frame to match the sample IDs
rownames(metadata) <- metadata$sample
```

## Calculate RPKM, TPM and FPKM These measures account for differences in sequencing depth and gene length.

### Normalise raw counts using edgeR

```{r}
# Create a DGEList object to store count data 
# (DGElist is used by the edgeR package to store RNA-seq data)
dge <- DGEList(counts = gene_counts)

# Calculate normalisation factors to scale counts appropriately
dge <- calcNormFactors(dge)
```

### Calculate Reads Per Kilobase Million (RPKM)

```{r}
# Calculate RPKM values (Reads Per Kilobase Million)
rpkm_values <- rpkm(dge, gene.length = gene_lengths)

# Save RPKM values
write.csv(rpkm_values, file = "RPKM_values.csv")
```

### Calculate Transcripts Per Million (TPM)

```{r}
# Calculate TPM values (Transcripts Per Million)
tpm <- function(counts, gene_length) {
    rpkm <- counts / (gene_length / 1000)
    scaling_factor <- colSums(rpkm) / 1000000
    tpm <- sweep(rpkm, 2, scaling_factor, "/")
    return(tpm)
}
tpm_values <- tpm(dge$counts, gene_lengths)

# Save TPM values
write.csv(tpm_values, file = "TPM_values.csv")
```

### Calculate Fragments Per Kilobase Million

```{r}
# Total fragments per sample (column sums of counts)
total_fragments <- colSums(dge$counts)

# Convert gene lengths to kilobases
gene_lengths_kb <- gene_lengths / 1000

# Calculate FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million)
fpkm_values <- sweep(dge$counts, 2, total_fragments / 1000000, "/")  # Normalise by total fragments (in millions)
fpkm_values <- sweep(fpkm_values, 1, gene_lengths_kb, "/") # Normalise by gene length (in kilobases)

# Save FPKM values
write.csv(fpkm_values, file = "FPKM_values.csv")
```

### Align column names of gene_counts with row names of metadata for compatibility

```{r}
colnames(gene_counts) <- rownames(metadata)
```

## Differential Expression Analysis using DESeq2

### Identify genes that are differentially expressed between control and treated samples

```{r}
# Create DESeq2 data set
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = gene_counts, colData = metadata, design = ~ condition)

# Run the DESeq2 analysis to identify differential expression
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Extract results and filter by significance (adjusted p-value < 0.01)
res <- results(dds, alpha = 0.1)
significant_genes <- res[which(res$padj < 0.01), ]

# Save significant genes
write.csv(as.data.frame(significant_genes), file = "Significant_Genes.csv")
```

### Generate a Volcano Plot to visualize significant genes based on adjusted p-value and log2 fold change

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

# Convert DESeq2 results to a data frame
volcano_data <- as.data.frame(res)  # 'res' is the DESeq2 results object

# Add gene names as a new column as currently the genes are listed without a column name
volcano_data$gene_name <- rownames(volcano_data)

# Remove rows with NA values in p adj or log2Fold-change
volcano_data <- na.omit(volcano_data)

# Filter only significant genes for labeling
volcano_data$significant <- volcano_data$padj < 0.01
label_data <- volcano_data[volcano_data$significant == TRUE, ]  # Only significant genes

# Select the top 10 most significant genes based on adjusted p-value
top10_genes <- label_data[order(label_data$padj), ][1:10, ]  # Sort by p adj and take top 10

# Plot the Volcano Plot with labels
ggplot(volcano_data, aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = -log10(padj), colour = significant)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) + # Add slightly transparent plot points
    scale_colour_manual(
    name = "Significance",  # Set legend title
    values = c("cornflowerblue", "indianred"),  # Colours for the points
    labels = c("Not Significant", "Significant")  # Update legend labels
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(data = top10_genes, 
                  aes(label = gene_name), # Add gene names as labels
                  size = 3, # Font size for labels 
                  max.overlaps = 10, # Limit the number of label overlaps
                  segment.colour = "transparent") +  # Hide line segments connecting labels to points 
  
  labs(title = "Volcano Plot of Differentially Expressed Genes", # Plot title 
       x = "Log2 Fold Change", # Label for x-axis
       y = "-log10 Adjusted P-Value") + # Label for y-axis
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top", # Position the legend at the top of the plot 
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) # Bold the plot title

# Save the plot as a PNG file. 
ggsave("Volcano_Plot.png", bg = "white") 
```

### Generate a Heat-map to visualize expression patterns for the top 20 significant genes

```{r}
# Perform Variance-Stabilizing Transformation (VST) for normalisation
vsd <- vst(dds, blind = FALSE)

# Select top 20 significant genes based on adjusted p-value
top_genes <- head(order(res$padj), 20)

# Extract normalised counts for the top genes
heatmap_data <- assay(vsd)[top_genes, ]

# Scale the data (Z-score normalisation across samples)
scaled_data <- t(scale(t(heatmap_data)))

# Reshape data for ggplot
library(reshape2) # Load reshape2 
heatmap_long <- melt(scaled_data) # Reshapes the data to long format 
colnames(heatmap_long) <- c("Gene", "Sample", "Expression") # Columns names to the reshaped data

# Produce a Heat-map
library(ggplot2) # Load ggplot2 for data visualisation 
ggplot(heatmap_long, aes(x = Sample, y = Gene, fill = Expression)) +
    geom_tile(colour = "white") + # White bordered tile for better visibility 
    scale_fill_gradient2(
      low = "dodgerblue", # Colour for low expression values 
      mid = "grey90", # Colour for mid-range expression values 
      high = "darkred", # Colour for high expression values 
      midpoint = 0) + # Centre the gradient at zero
    labs(
        title = "Heatmap of Top Differentially Expressed Genes", # Add plot title 
        x = "Samples", # Label for x-axis
        y = "Genes", # Label for y-axis 
        fill = "Z-score" # Label for colour legend 
    ) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10), # Rotate x-axis labels for readability 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8), # Adjust font size for y-axis labels 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5) # Adjust font size of the title, make bold and centre it
    )

# Save the plot as a PNG file
ggsave("Heatmap.png", bg = "white")

```

## Gene Ontology

YeastMine is no longer available due to discontinued support with its
alternative AllianceMine not reliable for enrichment analysis with our
gene lists for Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. For the sake of reproducing the
results we opted to use a tool/package in R which can do enrichment
analysis and has all the parameters we need such as Holm-Bonferroni
correction - clusterProfiler.

### Install and load libraries and dependencies

```{r}
# Installation
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("clusterProfiler")
BiocManager::install("org.Sc.sgd.db") # Annotation package for Saccharomyces cerevisiae
BiocManager::install("ReactomePA") # Install ReactomePA (for Reactome pathway enrichment)
BiocManager::install("biomaRt")

# Loading
library(clusterProfiler)
library(org.Sc.sgd.db)
library(ReactomePA)
library(biomaRt)
```

### Load the up and down regulated files in R for analysis

```{r}
# Extract up and down regulated genes

# Load the significant genes CSV file
significant_genes <- read.csv("~/Desktop/APP_BIO/ABCC_grp10/Significant_Genes.csv")

# Filter upregulated genes (Log2Fold-change > 0)
upregulated_genes <- significant_genes[significant_genes$log2FoldChange > 0, "X"] # X is the column name for which the gene names are listed - that is the only column we need

# Filter downregulated genes (log2Fold-change < 0)
downregulated_genes <- significant_genes[significant_genes$log2FoldChange < 0, "X"]

# Save upregulated genes to a text file
writeLines(upregulated_genes, "Upregulated_Genes.txt")

# Save downregulated genes to a text file
writeLines(downregulated_genes, "Downregulated_Genes.txt")

# Save upregulated and downregulated genes into plain text files
upregulated_genes <- readLines("Upregulated_Genes.txt")
downregulated_genes <- readLines("Downregulated_Genes.txt")

# Check the first few entries to confirm successful loading
head(upregulated_genes)
head(downregulated_genes)

# View the sum of upregulated and downregulated genes
print(length(upregulated_genes))
print(length(downregulated_genes))
```

## Perform GO Enrichment Analysis and Pathway Enrichment on Upregulated Genes

```{r}
library(clusterProfiler)
library(org.Sc.sgd.db)
library(ReactomePA)
library(biomaRt)

# Perform GO enrichment - Upregulated Genes
up_go_enrichment <- enrichGO(
    gene          = upregulated_genes, # Annotation database for Saccharomyces cerevisiae
    OrgDb         = org.Sc.sgd.db,
    keyType       = "ORF", # Use ORF (open reading frame) IDs as the gene list match this key type 
    ont           = "ALL", # Analyze all GO categories (Biological Process, Molecular Function, Cellular Component)
    pAdjustMethod = "holm", # Holm-Bonferroni correction
    pvalueCutoff  = 0.05, # P-value threshold
    qvalueCutoff  = 0.2 # Q-value threshold
)

# Convert ORF IDs to ENTREZ IDs for KEGG and Reactome pathway enrichment
# KEGG and Reactome use ENTREZ IDs as the unique identifier for gene models.
# Conversion is done using mapIds() to ensure compatibility with these tools.
orf_to_entrez <- mapIds(
    org.Sc.sgd.db,
    keys = upregulated_genes,
    column = "ENTREZID",           # Convert to ENTREZ IDs
    keytype = "ORF",               # Input key type is ORF
    multiVals = "first"
)
upregulated_genes_entrez <- na.omit(orf_to_entrez)

# Perform KEGG pathway enrichment
up_kegg_enrichment <- enrichKEGG(
    gene          = upregulated_genes_entrez,
    organism      = "sce",         # Saccharomyces cerevisiae
    pAdjustMethod = "holm",
    pvalueCutoff  = 0.05,
    qvalueCutoff  = 0.2
)

# Perform Reactome pathway enrichment
up_reactome_enrichment <- enrichPathway(
    gene          = upregulated_genes_entrez,
    organism      = "yeast",       # Use yeast for Reactome
    pAdjustMethod = "holm",
    pvalueCutoff  = 0.05,
    qvalueCutoff  = 0.2
)
```

### Check whether the mapIds() function successfully converted your ORF IDs to ENTREZ IDs:

```{r}
print(head(orf_to_entrez))
print(sum(is.na(orf_to_entrez))) # Count unmapped IDs
```

ORF IDs were successfully converted to ENTREZ IDs. '[1] 1' means 1 gene
ID from the original list could not be mapped to an ENTREZ ID. One
unmapped gene will not affect the rest of the analysis.

```{r}
# Print unmapped genes 
unmapped_genes <- names(orf_to_entrez)[is.na(orf_to_entrez)]
print(unmapped_genes)
```

When looking at the ENSEMBL Genome Browser "YNCG0047C" does not exist
which explains why it was not mapped. This will not impact subsequent
analysis as it will be automatically removed. The following code is used
to query ENSEMBL for the unmapped gene. This service was unavailable at
the time, therefore the code is commented out. To address this, the gene
was manually checked in the database was not found.

```{r}
# Connect to Ensembl (Saccharomyces cerevisiae data set)
#ensembl <- useMart("ensembl", data set = "scerevisiae_gene_ensembl")
#ensembl <- useMart("ensembl", data set = "scerevisiae_gene_ensembl", host = "http://www.ensembl.org") ## this is the mirror site

# Query Ensembl to get information about the gene
#conversion <- getBM(
    #attributes = c("external_gene_name", "entrezgene_id"),
    #filters = "external_gene_name",
    #values = "YNCG0047C",  # Replace with the gene you're searching for
    #mart = ensembl
#)

#print(conversion)  # Check if the gene exists in Ensembl
```

#### View and Save results for Upregulated Genes

```{r}
# View and save results
if (!is.null(up_go_enrichment)) {
  write.csv(as.data.frame(up_go_enrichment), "Upregulated_Genes_GO_Enrichment.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  message("GO enrichment results saved.")
} else {
  message("GO enrichment returned no results. Skipping.")
}

if (!is.null(up_kegg_enrichment)) {
  write.csv(as.data.frame(up_kegg_enrichment), "Upregulated_Genes_KEGG_Enrichment.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  message("KEGG enrichment results saved.")
} else {
  message("KEGG enrichment returned no results. Skipping.")
}

if (!is.null(up_reactome_enrichment)) {
  write.csv(as.data.frame(up_reactome_enrichment), "Upregulated_Genes_Reactome_Enrichment.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  message("Reactome enrichment results saved.")
} else {
  message("Reactome enrichment returned no results. Skipping.")
}
```

```{r}
print(length(upregulated_genes_entrez))  # Number of genes after mapping
print(sum(is.na(upregulated_genes_entrez)))  # Count of unmapped genes
```

There were 89 mapped genes in total, with no NA values. There were no
issues with the mapping process for the KEGG enrichment analysis and all
genes were successfully mapped to ENTREZ IDs. Absence of results from
the KEGG enrichment might be due to genes not being strongly associated
with any KEGG pathways based on the analysis parameters (p-value or
q-value cutoffs).

## Perform GO Enrichment Analysis and Pathway Enrichment on Downregulated Genes

```{r}
# Perform GO enrichment - Downregulated Genes

#### Check the downregulated genes after mapping to ENTREZ IDs, to see if any gene was not mapped

```{r}
print(length(downregulated_genes_entrez))
print(sum(is.na(downregulated_genes_entrez)))  # Number of unmapped genes
```

Since the result of sum(is.na(downregulated_genes_entrez)) is 0, that
means all downregulated genes were successfully mapped to ENTREZ IDs. No
mapping errors.

#### View and Save results for Downregulated Genes

```{r}
# View and save results
if (!is.null(down_go_enrichment)) {
  write.csv(as.data.frame(down_go_enrichment), "Downregulated_Genes_GO_Enrichment.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  message("GO enrichment results saved.")
} else {
  message("GO enrichment returned no results. Skipping.")
}

if (!is.null(down_kegg_enrichment)) {
  write.csv(as.data.frame(down_kegg_enrichment), "Downregulated_Genes_KEGG_Enrichment.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  message("KEGG enrichment results saved.")
} else {
  message("KEGG enrichment returned no results. Skipping.")
}

if (!is.null(down_reactome_enrichment)) {
  write.csv(as.data.frame(down_reactome_enrichment), "Downregulated_Genes_Reactome_Enrichment.csv", row.names = FALSE)
  message("Reactome enrichment results saved.")
} else {
  message("Reactome enrichment returned no results. Skipping.")
}
```

The KEGG enrichment results returned no results. This could be due to
the genes in the data set may not be well annotated in KEGG pathways
making them unsuitable to be represented by this enrichment. Or, the
specific p-value threshold used and correction test applied may have had
an effect, whilst making it harder for KEGG to identify trends.
