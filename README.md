# Reproducing RNA Seq Analysis 

#### Original Study: Adaptive laboratory evolution of native methanol assimilation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
#### DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19390-9

## Overview
This project aims to replicate the analysis from Espinosa et al., (2020) while adapting methods to ensure reproducibility. The study involves processing RNA-sequences data through alignment, counts, performing differential gene expression analysis and conducting gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis.
